## How it Works

1. Image Selection: The script selects images from a specified directory or a list of image URLs.
2. Slide Display: The current image is displayed in an HTML element.
3. Automatic Transition: The script uses setInterval() to automatically switch to the next image after a set interval, with a smooth fading transition.
4. Manual Control: Users can manually navigate through the slides using the navigation buttons.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/AliDeli80/automatic-slideshow.git
  ```

## Customization

- Image Source: Modify the image source to point to your desired image directory or URL list.
- Transition Duration: Adjust the setInterval() interval to control the speed of the slideshow.
- Transition Effects: Experiment with different CSS transition and animation properties to customize the visual effects.
- Navigation Button Style: Modify the CSS to change the appearance of the navigation buttons.
- Autoplay Behavior: Customize the autoplay behavior, such as adding a delay before the first slide or setting a specific autoplay interval.
